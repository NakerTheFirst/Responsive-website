# Responsive-website
A CSS &amp; HTML only website build as a part of a job interview task

## Additional info
- I follow CSS BEM methodology
- A preference: added additional whitespace in `style.css` for extra clarity
- Git commit name keywords I use across this and other projects: `Add`, `Fix`, `Update`, `Refactor`, `Merge` 
- Naturally the lack of coherence within animations is a serious design problem - however, I focused on implementation rather than the design
